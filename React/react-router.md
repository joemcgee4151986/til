I never thought the day where I would get HTML code working in React but that's what I've been doing. One issue that pops up is getting multiple pages working

correctly on your project. I solve this issue by using react router. Make sure to download it from the internet. 

Example:  npm install react-router-dom@6

yarn add react-router-dom@6

This page: https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/installation goes over how to set it up and get it working correctly. I did this I was able to get mine working correctly.
