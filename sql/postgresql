Here is a neat trick that allows you to insert tables into your database without much effort. 


Open VSCODE or any code editor that you use. 

Here is an example code: 
CREATE TABLE personal (
 first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 gender VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 email VARCHAR(50)
);
insert into personal (first_name, last_name,gender,email) values('John', 'Smith', 'Male','johnsmith@yahoo.com');
insert into personal (first_name, last_name,gender,email) values('Kate', 'Smithy', 'Female','katesmithy@gmail.com');

Save it as personal.sql

Next, go back to your sql shell and type \i and then the directory of personal.sql. 

Example: \i /sql/personal.sql;

Press enter and it will automatically create everything for you. 

To check that it work, type \d and you should see it. Type select * from personal and you should see everything in the personal table.
