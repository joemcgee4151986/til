One issue when working with an api is cors. If you don't know what it is, here is a little backstory: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

When testing the api, this error would pop up and prevent you from testing it. You could disable the error but you shouldn't. What I learn was to have my partner whitelist our domain 
and once that happened, the error disappeared and everything worked perfectly.
