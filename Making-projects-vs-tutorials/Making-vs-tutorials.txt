Most people when they start out, they read or watch tutorials online about making projects. However there are some people(me for instance) who get so caught up about making projects from tutorials that when they start to make their project, suddenly that hand you were holding is gone and it's much harder to start or can't do. Why is this in my til? Well, because today, I realized how much more learning there is when there is no one holding your hand. It's a feeling I really wish I did a long a time ago. 


I'm not saying never do tutorials. It has its place but if you want to be a better programmer, you should start making your own projects.
