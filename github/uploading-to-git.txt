When uploadin to git, make sure there is a file in your folder called ".gitignore" It will tell github what not to upload for security reasons.  

1) git init

2) If you want to add all of the files then do git add .

3) Once you done that, do a git commit. I've done git commit -m "insert comment here" Make sure to not be vagued with your comment especially if you're working in a team. 
People want to know what you did.

4) Once you're finished, do a git remote add origin and add the link of your git hub account. Example: git remote add origin https://github.com/joemcgee4151986/Frontpagereact.git
You can fine the link on the green button that says code. I usually do https option.

5) Finally, do a git push -u origin master  It will send your files to your github account. 


Congrats!
